# CS-255-Review
	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass client was looking to design a system for students to become better prepared for driving. 

	What did you do particularly well?
	
I feel I did particularly well when creating my UML diagrams and requirements for this system.

	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
	
When looking back I think I would revise some parts of my original requirements. I think there are some requirements that I would like to add, and some I’d like to remove, and after re-reading the interview with DriverPass I think that there are a few things that I would like to clarify. 

	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
	
I made sure to think about user security and verification. it’s important to think about user needs when designing a system because users are an important component of the system. 

	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
	
I approached designing this software by using a step-by-step approach, primarily using SDLC. This helped to decompose each step and give guidance as to what needed to be done. For future analysis, I will be utilizing similar techniques such as collecting information from customers, UML diagrams, and functional and technical requirements.
